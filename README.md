# CourtCast API

CourtCast API turns any basketball video into structured, query-ready stats & visualizations.

## Why CourtCast API?

Coaches, trainers, media editors, gambling startups, and even rec-league apps all want structured events (shot attempted, who, where, outcome, clock). Heat-maps are a nice by-product, but the real money is in a generic "video â†’ JSON" pipe they can drop into their own dashboards.

## Project Goal

To build a computer-vision pipeline that converts raw basketball video into event-level JSON and embeddable shot charts. Target metrics include:
*   93% shot-detection F1
*   14 cm median location error
*   Processing 60 games/hour on a single RTX 3070-Ti

This project aims to simulate beta customers, demonstrating a marketable product.

## Key Features (MVP)
*   **Player/Ball Tracking**: Detect and track ball and moving players to map to court position.
*   **Court Homography**: Map court keypoints to canonical court coordinates (0-94 ft, 0-50 ft).
*   **Event Grammar**: JSON spec (`{event:"shot", shooter_id, outcome:"miss", x, y, game_clock}`) similar to SportVU.
*   **Webhooks + Signed URLs**: "Job-done" callbacks.
*   **One-liner Widget**: Embeddable JavaScript widget for heat-maps/shot charts.

## Tech Stack Overview
*   **Detection/Tracking**: YOLOv11 + DeepSORT
*   **Event Classifier**: 1D Temporal CNN
*   **Homography**: RANSAC on key court lines
*   **Serving**: FastAPI + Uvicorn + Redis queue
*   **Storage**: TimescaleDB (PostGIS for spatial queries)
*   **Auth & Billing**: Stripe (metered usage)

## Progress Report (WIP)
### Week 1
* Setting up YOLOv11 for processing pre-labeled images of NBA in-game frames
    * Used for player/ball tracking
    * Images dataset from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/technion-ui0ov/basket-recognition-9ztqo/dataset/6) by Technion.
